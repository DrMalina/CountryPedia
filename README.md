# Countrypedia
SPA displaying data about countries from around the world. User is able to
search and filter countries along with viewing the detailed information of each
country on a separate page. The app also supports dark mode switcher.
Throughout the project I wanted to experiment and get some experience with
the Material-UI framework + Typescript.

Project's idea inspired by [Where In The World.](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)
